# TODO: Phiton Multi-Functional Python Code Compressor

## Overview

Transform `phiton` into a comprehensive Python code compression and minification toolkit that offers multiple techniques for code optimization. The original Phiton format will be renamed to "symbolic Phiton" with corresponding "symbolize"/"desymbolize" operations, while adding additional compression and minification techniques.

## Core Architecture Changes

- [ ] Refactor the codebase to support a plugin-based architecture for different compression techniques
- [ ] Create a unified API for all compression/minification methods
- [ ] Implement a configuration system to customize compression settings
- [ ] Design a pipeline system to chain multiple compression techniques

## Symbolic Phiton (Original Format)

- [ ] Rename current functionality to "symbolic Phiton"
- [ ] Update all references from "convert"/"deconvert" to "symbolize"/"desymbolize"
- [ ] Refactor `converter.py` to `symbolic.py` with appropriate class names
- [ ] Update CLI commands and documentation to reflect new terminology
- [ ] Optimize the symbolic representation algorithm for better compression ratios

## Minification Techniques

- [ ] Implement basic minification (whitespace removal, comment stripping)
- [ ] Add identifier shortening (variable/function/class name shortening)
- [ ] Implement import combining (merging adjacent import statements)
- [ ] Add constant folding (pre-calculating constant expressions)
- [ ] Implement dead code elimination
- [ ] Add removal of unnecessary pass statements
- [ ] Implement removal of unused docstrings and literal statements
- [ ] Add type annotation removal options

## Advanced Compression Techniques

- [ ] Implement literal hoisting (replacing repeated literals with variables)
- [ ] Add AST-based code transformation for size reduction
- [ ] Implement bytecode optimization techniques
- [ ] Add support for creating self-extracting compressed Python scripts
- [ ] Implement various compression algorithms (gzip, bzip2, lzma)
- [ ] Add support for ZIP container format (PEP 441)

## Lossless vs. Lossy Compression

- [ ] Clearly categorize each technique as lossless or lossy
- [ ] Implement warning system for lossy techniques that might affect functionality
- [ ] Create presets for different use cases (max compression, safe compression, etc.)
- [ ] Add detailed documentation about trade-offs for each technique

## CLI Enhancements

- [ ] Update CLI to support all new compression techniques
- [ ] Add command groups for different categories of operations
- [ ] Implement verbose logging for compression steps
- [ ] Add progress indicators for long-running operations
- [ ] Create shortcuts for common compression pipelines
- [ ] Implement batch processing for multiple files

## API Enhancements

- [ ] Design a comprehensive Python API for programmatic use
- [ ] Create builder pattern for chaining compression techniques
- [ ] Implement streaming API for handling large files
- [ ] Add callback hooks for monitoring compression progress
- [ ] Create detailed statistics reporting for compression results

## Testing and Validation

- [ ] Implement comprehensive test suite for all compression techniques
- [ ] Create benchmarking system to compare compression ratios and speeds
- [ ] Add validation tests to ensure code functionality is preserved
- [ ] Implement round-trip testing for all lossless techniques
- [ ] Create stress tests with large and complex Python codebases

## Documentation

- [ ] Update all documentation to reflect new terminology and features
- [ ] Create detailed guides for each compression technique
- [ ] Add examples of different compression pipelines
- [ ] Document best practices and recommended settings
- [ ] Create visual diagrams of the compression process
- [ ] Add benchmark results and comparison with other tools

## Integration

- [ ] Add pre-commit hook support
- [ ] Create GitHub Action for automated compression
- [ ] Implement CI/CD pipeline integration examples
- [ ] Add support for IDE plugins/extensions
- [ ] Create integration guides for common Python build systems

## Performance Optimization

- [ ] Profile and optimize core compression algorithms
- [ ] Implement parallel processing for batch operations
- [ ] Add caching mechanisms for repeated operations
- [ ] Optimize memory usage for large files
- [ ] Implement incremental compression for files that change frequently
