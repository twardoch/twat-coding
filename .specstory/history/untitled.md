This is the result of running 

Now update @TODO.md with what you've done. Then clean the @TODO.md so it focuses on immediate and further future, then perform the code cleanup, evaluate the results, make sure the NEXT TODO are well-chosen. Run the `./cleanup.py install && source .venv/bin/activate && ./cleanup.py update | cat` script in the main folder. Analyze the results, describe recent changes @TODO.md to update priorities and plan next changes. PERFORM THE CHANGES, then run the `./cleanup.py update | cat` script and react to the results. When you edit @TODO.md, lead in lines with empty GFM checkboxes if things aren't done (`- [ ] `) vs. filled (`- [x] `) if done, and `- [!]` if they're NEXT TODO. Don’t use `pip`, use `uv pip`. Ignore minor problems like "line too long", FOCUS ON MAJOR PROBLEMS!

I'll help analyze the cleanup results and update the TODO list accordingly. Let me break this down into steps:

1. First, let's analyze the major issues from the cleanup log:
- Failed test: `test_stub_generation_config` - private class exclusion not working
- Type annotation issues in `stub_generation.py`
- Complex functions that need refactoring
- Low test coverage in critical modules

2. Let me check the current state of the codebase:

Let me analyze the code and fix the private class exclusion issue. The problem appears to be in the `StubVisitor` class where the private class filtering logic is not working correctly.

I'll edit the file:
