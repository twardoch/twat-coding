_**Assistant**_

Let me break down each tool's functionality:

1. `pystubber.py`:
```markdown
A tool that generates empty Python package wheels (stub packages) with no actual implementation. Key features:

- Creates a minimal wheel package with just the package metadata
- Allows specifying package name, version, and output location
- Useful for creating placeholder packages or testing dependency resolution
- Uses Python's build system to generate proper wheel files
- Includes both CLI and programmatic interfaces

Example use case: Creating a dummy package to satisfy dependencies during testing or development.
```

2. `pystubnik`:
```markdown
A sophisticated tool for generating "shadow" Python files that preserve the structure but simplify the implementation. Key features:

- Preserves:
  - Function and class signatures
  - Import statements
  - Docstrings (with configurable length limits)
  - Class-level assignments
- Truncates:
  - Function bodies (replaced with `...`)
  - Large literals (strings, bytes, lists, dicts, etc.)
  - Long sequences
- Configurable limits for:
  - String lengths
  - Sequence lengths
  - Docstring lengths
  - File size thresholds
- Supports concurrent processing of multiple files
- Maintains file hierarchy when processing directories

Example use case: Creating simplified versions of large Python codebases for documentation, analysis, or IDE support.
```

3. `make_stubs.py`:
```markdown
A wrapper around mypy's stubgen functionality to generate .pyi stub files. Key features:

- Generates type stub files (.pyi) for Python modules
- Supports multiple modes:
  - Parse-only mode
  - Import and inspect mode
  - Documentation parsing
- Configurable options for:
  - Python version targeting
  - Import behavior
  - Error handling
  - Private member inclusion
  - Output directory
- Can process:
  - Individual modules
  - Entire packages
  - Specific files/directories

Example use case: Generating type stubs for third-party packages or your own code to improve type checking and IDE support.
```

4. `read_imports.py`:
```markdown
A focused tool for extracting and formatting import statements from Python files. Key features:

- Uses AST parsing to reliably extract imports
- Handles both regular imports and from-imports
- Preserves:
  - Import aliases
  - Relative imports
  - Multiple imports on single lines
- Outputs clean, formatted import statements
- Simple CLI interface

Example use case: Analyzing dependencies in Python files or extracting imports for documentation purposes.
```

These tools form a suite of utilities for working with Python code structure, particularly useful for:
- Package management and testing
- Code analysis and documentation
- Type checking and IDE support
- Dependency management

They seem to be complementary tools that could be used together in a larger workflow for Python project management and analysis.
